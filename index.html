  <p>Welcome throughout this website we will be talking about three various types of octopuses. (Yes yes I know y'all
    are going to be like "it's octopods" they are both technically correct and I like octopuses more so that is how I'm
    going to say it) The types of octopuses I will be talking about are the Blue-Ringed Octpus, the Flap Jack Octopus,
    and last but not least he Coconut octopus.</p>
