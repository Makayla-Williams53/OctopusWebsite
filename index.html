  <h1>Octopus Webpage</h1>

  <p class="inWeb">Welcome throughout this website we will be talking about three various types of octopuses. (Yes yes I know y'all are going to be like "it's octopods" they are both technically correct and I like octopuses more so that is how I'm going to say it) The types of octopuses I will be talking about are the Blue-Ringed Octpus, the Flap Jack Octopus, and last but not least the Coconut octopus.</p>

  <h3>Octopus Overview:</h3>

  <p class="inWeb">Now that you know the a little more information about those specific octopuses, there are some common atributes across all octopuses that you should know. Octopuses do not have bones, meaning that where ever their brain fits, they fit, this allows them to be excellent hiders. They also have eight tenticles most with the iconic suckers, and if they lose one in say a wicked battle to the death, it does grow back after about 100 to 130 days. A final thing that is absolutely crucial for you to know is that octopuses have three hearts, one for tenticle blood flow, one for brain blood flow, and one for blood flow to all the organs. For some further information about octopuses in general here is a website that will tell you all you want to know: </p>
